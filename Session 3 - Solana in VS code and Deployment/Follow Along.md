# Step 1

Create an Anchor framework.

```sh
anchor init <PROJECT_NAME>
```

# Step 2

Navigate to your project directory.

```sh
cd <PROJECT_NAME>
```

# Step 3

Copy your code from your playground code last week, then paste it inside of `/<PROJECT_NAME>/programs/<PROJECT_NAME>/src/lib.rs`

# Step 4

Upgrade your code now. Change it from a to do list, into a goal list. Do the program based on your creativity.

# Step 5

Build the project.

```sh
anchor build
```

# Step 6

Run tests.

```sh
anchor test
```
